          <h3>8th–11th centuries: Viking world</h3>
          <p>
            Communities from present-day Denmark, Norway, and Sweden participated in long-distance travel, trade, and raiding.
            Danish influence stretched toward England, Norwegian voyagers moved across the North Atlantic,
            and Swedish routes connected Scandinavia to the Baltic and eastward river networks.

          <h3>1397: The Kalmar Union</h3>
          <p>
            Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were formally united under one monarch through the Kalmar Union.
            Although cooperation varied in practice, the union became one of the clearest symbols of a shared Scandinavian political framework.

          <h3>1523: Sweden exits the union</h3>
          <p>
            Sweden separated from Danish-led union rule under Gustav Vasa. Norway remained in union with Denmark, and the Scandinavian balance changed.

          <h3>17th century: Era of rivalry</h3>
          <p>
            Sweden emerged as a major military power while Denmark-Norway contested influence in the Baltic and surrounding regions.
            Despite conflict, people, language, and commerce continued to flow across borders.

          <h3>1814–1905: Norway between unions and independence</h3>
          <p>
            After the Napoleonic period, Norway moved from union with Denmark to union with Sweden.
            In 1905, Norway peacefully dissolved its union with Sweden and became fully independent.

      <h2>From Rivalry to Cooperation</h2>
      <p>
        In the 20th and 21st centuries, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark transformed historical competition into institutional cooperation.
        They coordinate closely on labor mobility, security in northern Europe, welfare-state development, and clean-energy transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their relationship today is built on practical collaboration as well as deep historical familiarity—visible in language similarities,
        educational exchange, and interconnected cultural life.
